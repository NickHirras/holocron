# Contributing to Holocron
Thank you for your interest in contributing! Because this project is currently managed by a solo maintainer, I appreciate you following these guidelines to help keep the project stable and focused.

## The "Issue-First" Rule
Please **do not open a Pull Request** without first opening an Issue. 

Before you write any code:
1. Open an Issue describing the bug or feature request.
2. We will discuss the best implementation strategy.
3. Once we agree on the scope, I will invite you to submit a PR.

*PRs opened without a linked issue will be closed automatically.*

## Pull Request Guidelines
When you are ready to submit a PR:
* **One thing at a time:** Keep PRs small and focused on a single feature or bug fix.
* **Testing:** If you add a feature, please include tests. PRs without tests for new functionality will not be merged.
* **Style:** Please follow the existing code style (linting/formatting). 
* **Branching:** Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `fix/login-bug` or `feat/add-api-logging`).

## Approval Process
As the sole maintainer, I will review all PRs personally. 
* Please be patient; I review requests as my schedule allows.
* If I ask for changes, please commit them to the same branch; do not open a new PR.

Thank you for helping improve Holocron!
